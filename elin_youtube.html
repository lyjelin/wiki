            <h4>Why I started my Channel</h4>
            
            <div>
                <p>
                My <a href="https://www.notion.so/LeeYoonJeong_AITimes-Intern-Report-feb0d802553f4336baa5a1b01495667c" target="_blank">internship</a> on 2020 brought me to run a youtube channel.
                One of the most important things I've learned while working as an intern is to <strong>apply and implement what I've learn asap</strong>. So when I first heard about Notion, I decided to use it as my workspace.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                After first two weeks of using notion, I found it was very convenient work tool, as introduced in it's <a href="https://www.notion.so/about" target="_blank">official website</a>, notion was literally a <strong>all-in-one workspace</strong> compared to any other application or support tools I've ever tried before. <del>Of course, this is just my opinion.</del> And actually, I was attracted into its simple, minimal design. <del>Like Apple!</del> Another advantage was that I could easily find files&projects by categorizing them into categories.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                I am a person who tends to focus and explore deeply on the topic I am interested. But at the same time, I lose interest quite fast too.
                Because I know myself, I thought that if I force myself a little bit, I would be able to make efficient use (and maybe this might lead to increase productivity) of Notion as my workspace.
                
                <p>
                The reason why I chose YouTube is because when I was exploring various Notion functions, I found that as more I know, I could make better use in Notion.
                And this made me want to share my experience with others. So more people can be more productive.
                Also, through youtube, I could evaluate my sincerity and usefulness of information of my contents by feedback from audience: 'date', 'views' and 'likes'.
                </p>
                <p>
                So under my quote "Do what I think right away," I uploaded my first YouTube video on September 3!

                        My subscribers reached to 800. Though I wasn't able to upload additional contents during December because of finals + intern + preparation to return Hong Kong, around 400 people subscribed on my channel. I admit that I did not focus into my channel compared to when I first started because I needed to focus on my academic progress. <del>It was final examination! Whoever reading this right now, please undersatand that CompEng exams are sooooo tough</del>:(<br>
                        But this increse was giving me motivation to continue working on more contents, as it was reflecting that what I share in web was useful to many people! So what I've done was to create a new notion template, a financial tracker 2021 version.

                        Someone in twitter shared my financial tracker video, introducing that she found this useful! Thank you so much XD <br>

                        Since it is a final examination period, contents uploaded in December is less compared to November. However, despite the shortage of uploading, number of subscribers rose steadily by an average of 4-5 per day. Which I think this result is telling that the contents uploaded during the three months(September, October, and November) were useful videos for subscribers too.<br>

                        I tried appling SEO and self-promotion which I learnt during internship.<br>
                        <ul>
                            <li>People don't know who I am</li>
                            <li>I need to be confident on my content to promote myself</li>
                            <li>Importance of absorption : Join notion community (facebook, sns chat group, etc)</li>
                            <li>Created twitter account to share my notion templates</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        One most important standard I made myself was <strong>no viral advertising</strong>, as the goal of running this channel was not on earning profit but to gain experience and self-development.<br>
                        
                        Now: 195 subscribers.<br>
